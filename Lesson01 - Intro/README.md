# Lesson 01 - Introduction to JavaScript
***
## History
    JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape. Back then, JavaScript was originally called Mocha, then they changed to LiveScript, but they ended up naming JavaScript. The reason is that Java, which is a totally different programming language, was very popular, and everyone was saying that Java was the future. So they capitalized the Java hype and named JavaScript. As a consequence of that, many beginners get confused and think that they are the same.
    In 1997, JavaScript became an ECMA standard. Sometimes, you may heard someone saying that they code ECMAScript, instead of JavaScript. But they are the same, the difference is that ECMAScript is just a standard about how to write JavaScript code. 
    JavaScript is a versatile language since it is present everywhere. If you try to run away from the JS, it will definitely catch you. JavaScript most common use is on client-side web development. However, JS is also used for server, mobile, desktop and embedded systems.
    Therefore, if I were you, I would learn JavaScript!

## What is a JavaScript?
    JavaScript is Weak!
    What I mean is, JavaScript is not a strongly typed language, such as Java or C#, which means that the compiler cannot know what type is the  data of our variables until we run our script.

## Difference between JavaScript vs ECMAScript
    JavaScript is a programming language and ECMAScript is a specification responsible for defining standards for JavaScript
